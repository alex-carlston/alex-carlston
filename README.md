### 🧠 About Me

> “I build tools that empower credit unions to serve with brilliance, security, and ease.”

- 💡 **Visionary in Credit Union Technology**  
  I work at the intersection of **financial services** and **engineering**, crafting tools that drive member engagement and operational agility.

- 💻 **Symitar & PowerOn Pro**  
  Years of hands-on development on the **Symitar core**, including:
  - Custom PowerOn programming
  - Teller and back-office automations
  - Technology implementation into financial services

- 🌐 **Modern Web Stack Leader**  
  From idea to production, I design full-stack experiences using:
  - **Vue.js**, **Next.js**, **React**, **Node.js**
  - **Cloudflare Workers**, **JWT Auth**, **REST & SOAP APIs**
  - Pocketbase and Supabase BAAS

- 🔐 **Security-First, Always**  
  I build with a deep respect for member trust: CORS, asymmetric key auth, secure data flows, and IP controls.
